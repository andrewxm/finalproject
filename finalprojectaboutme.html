<h2>What is going on with me even?</h2>
<p>So what is there to say here? I don't really like talking myself up, but for the assignment let's give it the old college try. I guess I'll start when I was born? Yeah, that sounds good. So I was born on the Second of August in the year 1999, so yeah I'm what I like to call a "bare minimum ninety's kid", because I absolutely despise the term ninety's kid and the whole "only ninety's kids would know..." nonsense. I think it's total garbage, but I'm getting pretty steamed just typing this so enough of that. Anyways, I'm a student at Covina High School and I am looking to pursue a career in Concept Art and Design, because it's just really cool to me to see where the ideas of things from movies and such come from. So what was it that got me to that point, it was probably video games. I play them, a lot. Like to the point where I should be blind from looking at screens so much. I have no regrets, or shame. Okay maybe a little bit of shame, but no regrets. Welp that's pretty much all I'm willing to share, so enjoy the rest of the content I have to offer!</p>
