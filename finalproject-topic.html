<h2>What is going on with this topic even?</h2>
<h3>A career! Oh my!<h3>
	<p>So the career I am going to cover today is a career that I would like to do in the future, and that very career that I speak of is the career of concept design. Anyways I think it's really cool because they are the people who come up with the real ideas for movies, video games, and sometimes even technology. Like cars and stuff you know? Yeahhh I'm sure you know. Anyways that picture right there is a picture of some concept art and sadly I couldn't show a better one because google advanced search didn't allow it, but you know it's still kinda cool, right?</p>
