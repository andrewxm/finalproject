<h2>What is going on even?</h2>
<p>Exploring Computer Science (ECS) is literally just that, it's exploring the basics of computer science. In times like these Computer Science is pretty dang useful in the job market so it's probably a good thing that the counselors put me in here, but it's a bit more than just that. I enjoy it for the most part, but it has it's moments where I'm like "oh man do I really gotta do that?", but I endure it and I try my best to some degree. Anyways I enjoy it, so that whole nonsensical mumbo jumbo that I said earlier isn't all that important.</p>
